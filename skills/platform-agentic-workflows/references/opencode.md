# The engine: opencode on Forge

Verified against gh-aw **v0.83.4** by compiling and running against Numa.

Platform repositories run agentic workflows on our own model gateway. The wiring is spread
across three files and none of it is discoverable from the gh-aw docs.

---

## The contract

```yaml
engine:
  id: opencode
  version: "1.2.14"
  env:
    OPENAI_BASE_URL: https://forge.plainconcepts.com/v1

model: openai/glm-5-2
secrets:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}

max-turns: 300
max-turn-cache-misses: 3000
max-ai-credits: 5000

network:
  allowed:
    - defaults
    - forge.plainconcepts.com   # not in `defaults`; the firewall blocks it otherwise
    - dotnet                    # NuGet
    - node                      # npm, pnpm, yarn
```

All parts are load-bearing:

1. **`id: opencode` with a pinned `version`.** Experimental in gh-aw; the compiler says so on
   every compile. That warning is expected.
2. **All three budgets.** `max-turns` bounds tool loops. `max-turn-cache-misses: 3000` stops
   otherwise healthy runs failing at the compiler default of five consecutive misses, because
   Forge has no prompt cache so every turn is a miss. `max-ai-credits` gives multi-phase
   pipelines room.
3. **`network.allowed` includes `forge.plainconcepts.com`.** It is not in `defaults`, and the
   firewall blocking it presents as a *model timeout*, not a network error, which is expensive
   to diagnose.
4. **Ecosystem identifiers, not hostnames.** `dotnet` and `node` expand to every registry, CDN
   and OCSP endpoint. The compiler nags on every compile if you list hostnames.

---

## Where the model actually comes from

This is the part that confuses everyone, because the model is named in three places and only
one of them decides anything.

| Layer | Value | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| gh-aw `model:` | `openai/glm-5-2` | **Satisfies the compiler's provider validation. Nothing else.** |
| `opencode.ci.json` `model` | `plainconcepts/glm-5-2` | The model opencode actually loads |
| `opencode.ci.json` `provider.plainconcepts.api` | `http://172.30.0.30:10000` | Where the request goes: gh-aw's firewall proxy, which forwards to Forge |
| `engine.args: ["--model", ...]` | optional | A CLI override on top of the config |

The gh-aw provider segment **must** be one of `copilot`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `codex`.
Naming our own gateway is rejected at compile time:

```
unsupported provider "plainconcepts";
supported providers: copilot, anthropic, openai, codex
```

The segment only selects which client library gh-aw thinks it is configuring, so declaring the
OpenAI-compatible one is enough to get past validation. The real routing is done by
`opencode.ci.json`, whose `provider` block is not validated by gh-aw at all.

So a Platform repository **does** need a `plainconcepts` provider and **does** need the CI
merge step that installs it. An earlier version of this reference said the opposite; it was
written before the provider block existed and is wrong.

### Keep the model named once

`engine.args: ["--model", "plainconcepts/glm-5-2"]` is a CLI override that gh-aw passes through
without validating. It works, and it is redundant with `opencode.ci.json`'s top-level `model`.
Numa currently sets it on one worker out of five, which is exactly the state to avoid: five
workers, two of which would change model if you edited the config, and nobody able to tell
which without reading each file.

Pin the model in `opencode.ci.json` and leave `engine.args` out, or set it on every worker.
Not one.

### The CI config merge

`opencode.jsonc` is a developer's local config and is not tracked, so it does not exist in a CI
checkout. Without a merge step the only config the agent gets is the one gh-aw generates, which
declares provider `awf-proxy` with a model that is not ours.

The merge belongs in **`pre-agent-steps:`**, not `steps:`. Verified ordering inside the agent
job:

```
Checkout repository
steps:                                         <- too early
Checkout PR branch
Restore agent config folders from base branch  <- reverts opencode.jsonc
pre-agent-steps:                               <- correct window
Write OpenCode Config                          <- gh-aw merges its base on top
Execute OpenCode CLI
```

`steps:` runs before the base-branch restore, which lists `opencode.jsonc` in
`GH_AW_AGENT_FILES` and would undo the merge on any pull-request event.

Keep the fragment as **pure JSON**, not JSONC: `jq` cannot parse `//` comments, and a naive
comment-stripper corrupts the `http://` inside the provider's api URL.

gh-aw's own "Write OpenCode Config" step runs next and merges its base with
`$existing * $base`. Base wins on conflicting keys, but it defines neither `model` nor this
provider, so both survive.

---

## The CI agent prompt

`opencode.ci.json` carries a `ci-workflow-agent` whose prompt sets three policies worth knowing
before you write a workflow prompt that contradicts them.

**`gh` is intentionally unauthenticated.** The agent must not use `gh` for GitHub reads or
writes. Reads come from files you precomputed to `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/` or from the GitHub MCP
tools; writes go through `safeoutputs`. A workflow prompt that says "run `gh issue view`" will
burn turns and fail.

**Stop after the last safe output.** The agent is told a task is complete only once every
required Safe Outputs command succeeds, and to stop immediately afterwards without further
tools or prose.

**Output discipline.** gh-aw runs `opencode run --print-logs --log-level ERROR`, which
suppresses opencode's own diagnostics but not the model's narration between tool calls. There
is no flag for that; the only knob is the system prompt:

```text
OUTPUT DISCIPLINE: Do not narrate. Do not explain what you are about to do before doing it.
Do not write prose between tool calls. Call tools silently. The only prose you produce is the
final result or a brief error explanation when something fails.
```

Place it at the **end** of the agent `prompt` string. It applies to every workflow using the
shared CI agent, so no per-workflow change is needed. Local interactive sessions do not want
it: narration is useful when a human is reading along.

### Unattended repository reads

An Actions agent cannot approve a runtime permission request, so make it explicit:

```json
{
  "permission": {
    "read": "allow",
    "external_directory": { "/tmp/**": "allow" }
  }
}
```

Diagnose `The user rejected permission to use this specific tool call` as a CI permission
configuration problem, not a model or Safe Outputs failure.

## The shared setup file

Every worker imports one shared markdown file that prepares the runner. Three rules keep it
from becoming the least reliable part of the fleet.

**Pin every version.** A run that installs a different toolchain than the last one is not
reproducible, and a failure caused by a floating dependency reads as a model failure. Put the
pins in the shared file's `env:` block, which does merge from an import:

```yaml
env:
  OPENSPEC_VERSION: "1.8.0"
  RTK_VERSION: "0.44.1"
  RTK_SHA256: "986f29704469b3d1051e2474105c6c75ab8b73651068dcd61612c1fb3938ad95"
```

**Checksum anything you download.** A tarball fetched from a release page and installed to
`/usr/local/bin` is the one binary in the fleet nothing else verifies:

```bash
curl -fsSL -o "$tarball" "https://github.com/.../v${RTK_VERSION}/rtk-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz"
echo "${RTK_SHA256}  $tarball" | sha256sum --check --strict
```

**Do not swallow failures.** A chain of installs each ending in `|| echo "skipped"` produces a
silently degraded agent that then fails in a way that looks like bad judgement. Decide per
tool: if it is optional, mark it `continue-on-error: true` once and say so; if it is required,
let it fail. In particular `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile || pnpm install` hides lockfile
drift, which is the one failure you most want to see.

Take the package manager from the repository rather than installing a floating one:

```yaml
- run: |
    corepack enable
    corepack prepare --activate      # honours packageManager in package.json
```

Cache the stores. Every worker pays this setup cost on every run, and one `actions/cache` block
in the shared file covers all of them.

---

## Git identity inside the agent container

The framework sets up HTTP auth but not `user.name` or `user.email`, so any `git commit` inside
the agent fails:

```
fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'runner@3360f280c5cf.(none)')
```

The guardrails forbid touching git config, so use environment variables, which git respects
natively:

```yaml
env:
  GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: "github-actions[bot]"
  GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: "github-actions[bot]"
  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
```

---

## Bot pull requests

Two related traps when a worker opens pull requests as a bot.

**CI stalls at `action_required`.** GitHub may require manual approval before CI workflows
start on a bot's pull request. The run shows `status: completed`,
`conclusion: action_required`, `jobs: []`. The setting is **Settings → Actions → General →
Workflow permissions → "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**. It is
UI-only and cannot be set or verified by API. Even with it enabled, the *first* bot pull
request for a workflow may still need one approval.

The router handles the rest with a `bot-approve` route on `pull_request_target`, guarded on
`github.actor` being a trusted bot, which approves pending runs through the API. It takes
`actions: write` and no checkout, which is what makes `pull_request_target` acceptable here:
the fork's code is never fetched.

**`workflow_run` does not fire for approved runs.** GitHub's documented behaviour:

> `workflow_run` events are NOT triggered for workflow runs that were initially pending
> approval and then approved.

So after a manual approval, the merge-gate route never hears about the CI result. The pull
request sits open with no gate action. Mitigation is the repo setting above; if a pull request
does go down that path, dispatch the router with `operation=merge-gate` and the number.

---

## The trap: `tools:` is ignored

```
⚠ 'tools' section ignored when using engine: opencode
  (OpenCode doesn't support MCP tool allow-listing)
```

The compiler prints that once and drops the **entire** `tools:` block. Verified by compiling a
workflow with `tools.cache-memory` configured and finding zero references in the resulting lock
file. This entry is the sole source of truth for this trap.

| You wrote | What happens |
|---|---|
| `tools: bash: ["gh run view"]` | Dropped. The agent's shell is unrestricted |
| `tools: cache-memory:` | Dropped. No cache is created or restored |
| `tools: repo-memory:` | Dropped. No memory branch |
| `tools: github: toolsets: [issues]` | Dropped. The GitHub MCP server is mounted unrestricted |
| `mcp-servers:` | Dropped |

Three consequences:

**Do not write a `tools:` block.** Dead configuration that reads like a control is worse than
none: the next reader believes the workflow is constrained when it is not.

**The constraints that remain are the ones that matter.** `permissions: read-all` means the
token cannot write. `safe-outputs` with `allowed:` lists means writes are enumerated and
validated. `network.allowed` filters egress. Those are enforced outside the agent, so they hold
regardless of what the engine supports.

**Persistence needs another mechanism.** Store state where GitHub already stores it: a label, a
comment, an issue body. An explicit `actions/cache` step at rung 3 works for build caches, but
GitHub is the database for anything a human should be able to see.

---

## Budgets

| Field | Works under opencode | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `timeout-minutes:` | yes | Job wall clock. An implement agent needs 60 to 120 |
| `max-turns:` | yes | **Platform: `300`.** The real guard against a confused agent looping |
| `max-turn-cache-misses:` | yes | **Platform: `3000`.** Forge has no cache, so every turn is a miss |
| `max-ai-credits:` | unreliable | **Platform: `5000`.** Only engages when traffic passes gh-aw's proxy accounting |
| `tools.timeout:` | no | Inside the dropped block |

---

## Cost telemetry

gh-aw's AI Credits system tracks usage automatically, visible in the Actions run summary and in
the `effective_tokens` job output. Do not report tokens in issue comments: it duplicates the
run summary and Forge routing often yields `not reported` anyway.

`gh aw audit <run-id>` gives duration, tokens, credits and turn count when the proxy observed
the traffic, and `gh aw logs --format markdown` gives a cross-run report with anomaly
detection. The proxy log at `sandbox/firewall/logs/api-proxy-logs/token-usage.jsonl` may be
absent entirely.

---

## Self-hosted runners

Platform workflows target `ubuntu-latest`. The fleet moved off `[self-hosted, linux, agents]`
in `0fc7b08`; the model comes from Forge either way, so the only thing the self-hosted runner
provided was a queue of one.

**Never on a public repository.** A fork pull request would execute arbitrary code on a machine
holding your credentials.

If a repository moves back, all three runner keys must be set together or the framework jobs go
to a GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-slim`:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, agents]
runs-on-slim: [self-hosted, linux, agents]
safe-outputs:
  threat-detection:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, agents]
```

A persistent machine breaks assumptions a hosted runner lets you make:

- **A step that installs something may find it already there.** `gh extension install
  github/gh-aw` exits non-zero with *"there is already an installed extension"*. Fall back to
  `upgrade` and assert with `gh aw version`.
- **The runner's user does not own `/usr/share`.** `actions/setup-dotnet` installs there by
  default and fails. Set `DOTNET_INSTALL_DIR` to `${{ runner.tool_cache }}/dotnet`.
- **The workspace persists between runs.** A `.npmrc` written with a token stays. A build
  output directory from a previous run is still there, so a `[ -d dist ]` check can bundle
  stale artifacts. Clean what you create, and write transient state to `$RUNNER_TEMP`.

---

## Other engines

| Engine | `id` | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot (gh-aw default) | `copilot` | `copilot-requests: write` or `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` |
| Claude Code | `claude` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI Codex | `codex` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | `gemini` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |

`claude` and `copilot` both support `tools:` properly, so a repository that genuinely needs
tool allow-listing or `cache-memory` has a reason to pick one. That is a deliberate trade
against Forge, not a default: state it in the workflow's `description:` if you make it.
